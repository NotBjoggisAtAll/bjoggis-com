Welcome to my first post! 

This is my first time trying to write a blog and I'm excited to see how it goes.

As my day job I work as a Java developer at PayEx in Oslo, Norway. I primarily work with Spring Boot, but also a bit of frontend work using Vue.

Here you can expect to see posts about my developer journey and other things I find interesting. I'm currently in the works of setting up a home lab using RaspberryPi cluster and will be posting more about that when I get it up and running.

I wish you all merry christmas and a happy new year! :santa:
