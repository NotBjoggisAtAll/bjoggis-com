# Welcome to my blog!

My name is Jonas Bj√∏rge Andersen and I'm a software developer from Norway.

On this page you will find my blog posts about my developer journey and other things I find interesting.

I have already posted one post about my home lab, which you can find [here](/blog/hello-world/).

This site is created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which is completely new to me. I will probably be changing the format and design of the site a lot in the beginning as I learn more about Hugo and how to use it.
